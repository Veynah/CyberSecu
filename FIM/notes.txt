Exactly same files will have same hashes
To get the hash in powershell, you need to type "Get-FileHash 'nameOfTheFile' -Algorithm SHA1"
Changing anything in the file will completly change the hash of the file
Even putting a space at the end of a file for exemple will change the hash
No matter what the size of the file, the size of the hash will still be the same, 160 bits
Even if you empty the file, the hash will still be 160 bits
The hash will be the same size depending on the hashing Algorithm
